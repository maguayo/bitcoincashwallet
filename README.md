Bitcoin Cash Wallet
===

This is a boilerplate react-native repository for bitcoinjs-lib testing.

## Setup

```
yarn install
react-native run-ios
```

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can run the following command:

```
yarn cache clean
```

Make sure you have installed "process".
```
npm install process
```

Sometimes the library `bip39` returns an error related to rng. In this case install the lirbary from `github.com://maguayo/bip39`
